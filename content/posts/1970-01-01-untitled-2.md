Ich habe neulich meine originale Doom 3 DVD wieder gefunden. Das Game wurde damals noch für die PowerPC Architektur 2004 veröffentlicht und läuft folglich nicht so ohne weiteres auf einem Intel geschweige denn ARM Macintosh (M1 Chips). Ich habe viele verschiedene Dinge durchprobieren müssen, damit mein originales Doom 3 legal auf meinem MacBook Pro 2016 und meinem MacBook Pro M1 Pro läuft. Doch das tut es nun endlich. Und es ist großartig. Das Spiel hat nach wie vor eine unglaubliche Dichte und Atmosphäre und ich bekomme heute noch krasse Schrecksekunden, wenn ich es spiele. 

Es gab einen Patch der die PPC App auf eine Universal Binary aktualisierte (official patcher to update game & base to [v1.3.1A PPC+Intel](http://download.macintoshgarden.org/games/Doom3Mac1.3.1RevA.dmg) year 2007), heißt also damit lief das Spiel auch auf den neuen Intel Macs. Allerdings nur so lange 32-Bit Apps unterstützt wurden. Irgendwann [2017 stellte Apple vollständig auf 64-Bit](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12012017a) um - mein Doom 3 lief also wieder nicht mehr. 

I have the pk4 files in the base folder, etc.

> base

game00.pk4

game02.pk4

pak000.pk4

pak001.pk4

pak002.pk4

pak003.pk4

pak004.pk4

pak005.pk4

Following instructions from here:

I downloaded the Dhewm3_Catalina.zip

Extracted the files.

Doom [3.app](https://3.app/)

base-15.dylib

base.dylib

And placed them into my Doom3 folder where the 'base' folder is.

If you already have a [Doom3.app](https://doom3.app/) file, rename it Doom3 (original) or something, or move it to a new folder first.

Try to start the game. Doesn't work.

So, I install Homebrew.

After that was installed I added the additional libraries via terminal as per the terminal code on

[https://docs.brew.sh](https://docs.brew.sh/)

Then:

brew update

Then:

brew install openal-soft

brew install libvorbis

brew install libjpeg

brew install SDL2

When trying to run the game, mac says there's error or an problem. I did the "xattr" stuff mentioned in the forum. Then tried to run it again, then went into Security & Privacy Control Panel to allow access to the file it was preventing access to. I think it was "base-15.dylib" then tried to run the game again. And again went to the Security panel to allow access to the other file "base.dylib". Tried to start the game again. It started!

I could access the setup panel, set up controls, screen size etc., but when I started a new game, I got an error. Oh, you need to choose MODS from the game's start screen, and load the Dhewm3 mod. But, that doesn't work either, yet, and gets an error:

ERROR: missing 'weapon_netfiring' field in script object 'weapon_fists'

I looked around and found this:

[https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3/issues/133](https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3/issues/133)

Seems Doom3 put out an official patch many years ago, I need that patch.

"you have to patch your game to version v1.3.1"

Okay. But, when I downloaded the Doom3Mac1.3.1RevA.dmg patch, of course it's 32bit and won't work. So, I found this:

[https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3/wiki/FAQ](https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3/wiki/FAQ)

[the official 1.3.1 patch for Linux](http://files.holarse-linuxgaming.de/native/Spiele/Doom%203/doom3-linux-1.3.1.1304.x86.run)

[http://files.holarse-linuxgaming.de/native/Spiele/Doom%203/doom3-linux-1.3.1.1304.x86.run](http://files.holarse-linuxgaming.de/native/Spiele/Doom%203/doom3-linux-1.3.1.1304.x86.run)

I don't know what to do with a .run file.

But following the suggested terminal code:

sh /path/to/doom3-linux-1.3.1.1304.x86.run --tar xvf --wildcards base/pak* d3xp/pak*

which didn't work, but some help suggestions came up in terminal and

I used:

sh /path/to/doom3-linux-1.3.1.1304.x86.run --tar xf

and that extracted the files fine.

Just type "sh " then drag the [doom3-linux-1.3.1.1304.x86.run](https://doom3-linux-1.3.1.1304.x86.run/) file to terminal and it will paste the path to the file for you. So much easier than trying to figure it out yourself. Also, it will extract the files into whichever folder you are currently in. By default, terminal is in your /Users/YourUserName/ so you might want to change it. Maybe make a "newfolder" then in terminal type: cd newfolder. Then run the extraction code.

So, you will be confronted with a lot of files. Most of which you do not need because they are for either linux or windows. All I needed were in the 'base' folder:

game01.pk4

game02.pk4

game03.pk4

pak005.pk4

pak006.pk4

pak007.pk4

pak008.pk4

Back in the Doom3 folder, I renamed the "base" folder to "base (original)" and made a new folder called "base". From the "base" folder in the extracted files, copied those seven pk4 files to the new base folder I created in Doom3. Then, from the "base (original)" folder, copied all of those files over to the new "base" folder too. Some files already exist and when asked if I want to replace them, said NO to all of them.

Now I try to start the game. Load the Dhewm3 MOD. Start a New Game. WORKS!!!!

Next I wanted to make the game wide-screen as the default is for the old square screens.

When in the game hit ` (to the left of 1 on the mac keyboard) to bring up the in-game terminal.

If you set r_mode -2 it will be your display's native resolution
If you set r_mode -1 you may use custom resolution (this is what I want)

Set These Console variables:

set r_mode -1

set r_customWidth 1920

set r_customHeight 1080

set r_aspectRatio 1

vid_restart

You might have to restart the game for some settings to take effect, such as Full Screen. There are many other Console variables, they're easy to look up. Supposedly, after custom width and height, the game is widescreen, but the HUD and in-between animations are stretched. I didn't even notice.

I hope this help some people. If I run into any probs, I'll try to update this or comment.

P.S. I also set up the original DOOM using Freedoom. [https://freedoom.github.io/](https://freedoom.github.io/)

I got some help setting it up on their discord server. Super fun to play the old DOOM.

64-bit Requirement for Mac Apps - Latest News - Apple Developer

As a reminder, new apps submitted to the Mac App Store must support 64-bit starting January 2018, and Mac app updates and existing apps must support 64-bit starting June 2018. If you distribute your apps outside the Mac App Store, we highly recommend distributing 64-bit binaries to make sure your users can continue to run your apps on future versions of macOS. The last macOS release to support 32-bit apps without compromise is macOS High Sierra.Learn more about distributing Mac apps.
