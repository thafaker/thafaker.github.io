now it’s computers and more computers
and soon everybody will have one,
3-year olds will have computers
and everybody will know everything
about everybody else
long before they meet them
and so they won’t want to meet them.
nobody will want to meet anybody
else ever again
and everybody will be
a recluse
like i am now.
`(Bukowski wrote this some time before 1994)`
