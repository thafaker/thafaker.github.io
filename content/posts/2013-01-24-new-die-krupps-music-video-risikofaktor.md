Here is the new single from the upcoming DIE KRUPPS album 'The Machinists of Joy'.

I was blessed enough to recently connect with the lead singer of one of my favorite bands, DIE KRUPPS, and we came up with a concept for a video without a budget and created what you can watch here. Hope you all enjoy it.
