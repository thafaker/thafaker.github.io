Ich habe bei mir rumgew체hlt, ein wenig aufger채umt und  das "fette" Teil wiedergefunden. F체r mich der beste Song von **Nirvana** 체berhaupt und bei **Tube** das Video gefunden.

> When I'm feeling tired,
> She pushed food through the door.
> I crawl towards the cracks of light.
> Sometimes I can't find my way.
> Newspapers spread around.
> Soaking all that they can.
> A cleaning is due again
> A good hosing down
> 
> The lady whom I feel maternal love for
> 
> Cannot look me in the eyes.
> 
> But I see hers and they are blue.
> 
> And they cock and twist and masturbate!
> 
> I said so
> 
> Nirvana
> 
> Black windows of paint,
> 
> I scratched with my nails.
> 
> I see others just like me.
> 
> Why do they not try to escape?
> 
> But we're not the only ones.
> 
> They point in my way.
> 
> They come with a flash of light.
> 
> And take my family away.
> 
> And very later I have learned
> 
> To accept some friends of ridicule.
> 
> My whole existence is for your amusement.
> 
> And that is why I'm here with you!
> 
> Don't take
> 
> Me away
> 
> You're right.
