Die [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5562864/lifehacker-pack-for-mac-our-essential-list-of-the-best-free-mac-downloads?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+lifehacker%2Ffull+%28Lifehacker%29) haben mal wieder ihr *Lifehacker Pack for Mac* vorgestellt. Dieses Paket ist eine Sammlung von Software für den Mac, welche die Kategorien **Produktivität**, **Medien**, **Internet**/**Kommunikation** und **Utilities** abdeckt. Die Software ist Free- oder Shareware und gleich mit einem Link zum Download versehen.

### Produktivität
![thafaker.de presents Lifehacker Pack for Mac](//picdump.thafaker.de/2010/06/thumb160x_quicksilver_02.jpg)**[Quicksilver](http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-alchemy/downloads/list):** Quicksilver is an application launcher and then some, capable of  browsing your file system, firing off quick emails, flipping through  your iTunes library, and much, much more. It can be a bit difficult to  wrap your head around, so rather than go into too much detail here,  check out our beginner  guide, settings  tweaks, and video  demonstrations. [[Download](http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-alchemy/downloads/list)]

![thafaker.de presents Lifehacker Pack for Mac](//picdump.thafaker.de/2010/06/thumb160x_bean_02.jpg)**[Bean](http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html):** You're on a  Mac, and chances are pretty good you're not eager to shell out cash for  Microsoft Office to open and edit the occasional Word document. Bean is  an extremely fast, lightweight document editor (and written in Cocoa)  that handles Word documents like a gem. It's not a replacement for Word,  but if you don't need everything that word offers (and you don't want a  bloated replacement like OpenOffice.org), Bean's a great option. [[Download](http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html)]

![thafaker.de presents Lifehacker Pack for Mac](//picdump.thafaker.de/2010/06/thumb160x_notational_velocity_02.jpg)**[Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/):** This  brilliant little note-taking application creates, searches, tags, and  syncs plain text notes between desktops, the web, and even your iPhone  (syncing takes place either through Dropbox [see below] or the excellent  web-based [Simplenote](http://simplenoteapp.com/)). If you're  an obsessive plain text note-taker or to-do list creator, you won't  regret giving it a test run. [[Download](http://notational.net/)]

![Lifehacker Pack for Mac: Our List of the Best Free Mac Downloads](//cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2010/06/textwrangler_02.jpg)**[TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/):** If you do heavier text editing than Notational Velocity offers—like,  say, coding—free text editor TextWrangler is a great tool for the job. A  good share of Mac fans pony up for premium apps like TextMate,  but if you don't feel like shelling out $50 to get your coding on,  TextWrangler's a great option. [[Download](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)]

### Internet/Communication
![thafaker.de presents Lifehacker Pack for Mac](//picdump.thafaker.de/2010/06/thumb160x_google_chrome_02.jpg)**[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html)/[Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome):** These two are  fighting for default browser status on many a Mac, and frankly, they're  neck and neck in our hearts at this point. Google just dropped the beta  tag from Chrome for Mac and released their first stable build;  meanwhile, Firefox still has a few features we'd sorely miss if we  switched over to Chrome. For now, we'd happily recommend either.  [Download: [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html)/[Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome)]

![thafaker.de presents Lifehacker Pack for Mac](//picdump.thafaker.de/2010/06/thumb160x_adium_02.jpg)**[Adium (archiviert)](http://web.archive.org/web/20100615012637/http://www.adium.im:80/):** Adium is hands-down the best multi-protocol instant messaging client  we've used on any platform. It's completely customizable, works with  almost any chat network you'd want, and still outdoes iChat on most  fronts. (Though if you're a big user of iChat's admittedly great screen  sharing and video chat tools, it's unfortunately not up to snuff on  those points.) [[Download (archiviert)](http://web.archive.org/web/20100615012637/http://www.adium.im:80/)]

![thafaker.de presents Lifehacker Pack for Mac](//picdump.thafaker.de/2010/06/thumb160x_cyberduck_02.jpg)**[Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/):** This excellent open  source client can connect to and upload/download files via FTP, SFTP,  WebDAV, Amazon S3, and even Google Docs. Cyberduck's impressive feature  list is a little too long to dive into, but if you thought you needed to  pay money for a solid FTP client on your Mac, take a look at Cyberduck  first. [[Download](http://cyberduck.ch/)]

![Lifehacker Pack for Mac: Our List of the Best Free Mac Downloads](//cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2010/06/fluid_02.jpg)**[Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/):** If you turn to web applications more than you do desktop apps, this  free, open source tool creates standalone "apps" for any web site you  throw at it. With the right set of user scripts and tweaks, your  Fluid-made site-specific-browsers (or SSBs) can display Growl  notifications, Dock badges, and make your web apps feel more like  they're running on your desktop. [[Download](http://fluidapp.com/)]

### Utilities
![thafaker.de presents Lifehacker Pack for Mac](//picdump.thafaker.de/2010/06/thumb160x_the_unarchiver_02.jpg)**[The Unarchiver](http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html):** Your Mac's built-in Archiver Utility isn't bad, but if you regularly  traffic in archive file types like the popular RAR format, it can't  handle all your needs. The Unarchiver unpacks traditional ZIP archives  along with RAR, TAR, 7Z, Stuffit, and most obscure archive types you  could get your hands on. [[Download](http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html)]

![Lifehacker Pack for Mac: Our List of the Best Free Mac Downloads](//cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2010/06/utorrent_02.jpg)**[uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/)/[Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/):** It  used to be that when it came time to download something on your Mac via  BitTorrent, you only really had one solid choice: the open source [Transmission](http://lifehacker.com/5562864/lifehacker-pack-for-mac-our-essential-list-of-the-best-free-mac-downloads?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+lifehacker%2Ffull+%28Lifehacker%29).  But as of just a few days ago, uTorrent—the most popular BitTorrent  client for Windows—upgraded to a 1.0 release. uTorrent for Mac still  isn't up to snuff when compared to the Windows version, but we still  think it's a solid alternative to Transmission—though some would argue  that Transmission is more "Mac-like". [Download: [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/)/[Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/)]

![thafaker.de presents Lifehacker Pack for Mac](//picdump.thafaker.de/2010/06/thumb160x_burn_02.jpg)**[Burn](http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/Pages/English/home.html):** OS X's built-in Disk Utility is actually quite good at burning ISOs and  other disk images to optical media like CDs and DVDs, but the  aptly-named, open-source Burn is a great supplement for less esoteric  burning duties. Burn handles data, audio, video, and disc copying in a  very user-friendly interface. [[Download](http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/Pages/English/home.html)]

![Lifehacker Pack for Mac: Our List of the Best Free Mac Downloads](//cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2010/06/growl_02.jpg)**[Growl](http://growl.info/):** Growl is a universal system notification tool that displays attractive  system notifications and integrates with nearly every really popular Mac  application (including the majority of the apps on this list). As handy  and popular as this universal notification application is, it's still  hard to believe it  hasn't been built into OS X already. [[Download](http://growl.info/)]

![Lifehacker Pack for Mac: Our List of the Best Free Mac Downloads](//cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2010/06/dropbox_02.jpg)**[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/):** This handy utility adds a Dropbox folder to your user directory and  instantaneously syncs any file you add to, edit, or delete from that  folder to Dropbox's cloud servers and to any other computer you've  installed Dropbox on. If you regularly move around between a couple of  computers or you just wouldn't mind a way to access and back up a few of  your most important files, Dropbox is a must. [[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/)]

![Lifehacker Pack for Mac: Our List of the Best Free Mac Downloads](//cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2010/06/mozy_02.jpg)**[Mozy (archiviert)](http://web.archive.org/web/20100616014540/http://mozy.com:80/):** We regularly preach the importance of backup, and the newest release of  Mozy is a double-threat of both on-site and off-site backup with  impressive ease of use. You get the local backup and 2GB of online  backup for free, or for $5 a month, you get unlimited online backups. We  don't normally urge people to pry open their pocketbooks, but with  Mozy's unlimited backup, we strongly believe it's worth it. [[Download (archiviert)](http://web.archive.org/web/20100616014540/http://mozy.com:80/)]

### Medien
![thafaker.de presents Lifehacker Pack for Mac](//picdump.thafaker.de/2010/06/thumb160x_vlc_02.jpg)**[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/):** Throw any video or  audio file you can find at VLC and it'll play it, no matter how obscure  the format. While not necessarily as friendly on the eyes as QuickTime,  VLC is a workhorse of a media player that we've turned to in many a  dark hour when it looked like a file might not play. [[Download](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)]

![thafaker.de presents Lifehacker Pack for Mac](//picdump.thafaker.de/2010/06/thumb160x_itunes_02.jpg)**[iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/):** iTunes may be  one of the most controversial apps on this list. Some love it, some hate  it, but the fact remains that if you're firmly planted in Apple  hardware and software, iTunes is the glue that keeps all of your media  together. And if you're an iPhone/iPod/iPad owner, it's still a must. [[Download](http://www.apple.com/itunes/)]

![Lifehacker Pack for Mac: Our List of the Best Free Mac Downloads](//cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2010/06/seashore_02.jpg)**[Seashore](http://seashore.sourceforge.net/):** Photoshop  may be the gold standard for image editing, but if all you need to do  is some basic photo editing and you don't want to fire up an industrial  workhorse to get it done, Seashore is a handy tool to have on hand. [[Download](http://seashore.sourceforge.net/)]

![thafaker.de presents Lifehacker Pack for Mac](//picdump.thafaker.de/2010/06/thumb160x_picasa_02.jpg)**[Picasa (archiviert)](http://web.archive.org/web/20100619032153/http://picasa.google.com/mac/):** If you're  unhappy with iLife's default photo management software, iPhoto—and many  Mac users on the Lifehacker staff are—Google's Picasa offers a strong  alternative. It handles many of the same features iPhoto does, plus it  integrates like a charm with your Google account and Picasa Web Albums  online. [[Download (archiviert)](http://web.archive.org/web/20100619032153/http://picasa.google.com/mac/)]

![Lifehacker Pack for Mac: Our List of the Best Free Mac Downloads](//cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2010/06/handbrake_02.jpg)**[Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/):** Got a DVD you'd like to rip to your hard drive in a high-quality,  portable-device-friendly format? Turn to the extremely popular, always  handy Handbrake. [[Download](http://handbrake.fr/)]
