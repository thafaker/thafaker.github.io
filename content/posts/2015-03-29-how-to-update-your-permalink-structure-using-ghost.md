It was a really hard way to figure out how I actually can edit the permalink structure of my new ghost weblog. It is really important to have the same structure like I had in my [wordpress weblog](__GHOST_URL__/neues-theme) before, because otherwise all my published URLs in facebook etc. pp. won't work anymore. And here in ghost, you can't change that behaviour as you can do in other CMS.

In Wordpress, it was `/year/month/title` but in ghost, after the import, it is `/year/month/title/day` and that leads into an 404 not found error.

But there is help. Easy help. Just follow the *how-to* over at [perezbox](http://perezbox.com/2014/12/permalinks-in-ghost/) and that problem will easy be done :-)

Thank you.
