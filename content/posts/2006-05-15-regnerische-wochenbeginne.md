*Pete Doherty &ndash; Their Way*

*Their way
Forces your hand
There was no way to tell you
I just hoped you'd understand
I was waiting for you
Alone with that boy
He needed a sympathy
He just didn't want to have to say why*

*This way I'll always be (for you)
And to see you now and help me on
You know they like to knock me down
But I don't stay down for very long*

*I couldn't win but I could lose
And so the time had come and I knew I'd have to choose
But that kiss, I take to the end
Until the next time I get to see you again*

*This way I'll always be for you
And to know you now will see me through
(Away) you know I knew you there
And to see you know and help me on
You know they like to knock me down
But I don't stay down for very long
They try to sing their wayward song
But oh what a way I found*

*This way I'll always be for you
And to know you now will see me through
(Away) you know I knew you there
I don't stay down for very long
You know they like to knock me down
But I don't stay down for very long
They tried to say their wayward song
But oh what a way I've found*
