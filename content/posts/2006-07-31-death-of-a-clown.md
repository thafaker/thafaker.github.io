My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin

I’m drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin Kinks

The lion tamer’s whip doesn’t crack anymore

The lions they won’t fight and the tigers won’t roar Death

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

So let’s all drink to the death of a clown Of

Won’t someone help me to break up this crown

Let’s all drink to the death of a clown Clown

Let’s all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor Songtexte

Nobody needs fortunes told anymore

The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees Songtext

And frantically looking for runaway fleas
