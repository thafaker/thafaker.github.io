Einfach großartig, was der Mann da für eine geile [Musikmaschine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QMtDyvAzVw&sns=em) gebaut hat.

`EOL Robot Band covers The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson`

Intially I was working on my own version of Mad World and I did complete it however the Robot Cello didn't work out because the sound of the solenoids and stepper motor was drowning out the song. The Cello also did a lousy job of playing long notes. The printer head would exceed the left or right limit and change direction causing an interuption to the note being played (maybe a wide carriage printer will work better for long notes?). Slowing down the stepper motor did not work because it didn't generate enough movement to create a sound with the bow. So I scrapped the project altogether. One night I was working on the Cello and the stepper motor started to jitter almost ripping the Cello sting and Bow apart. As I was jumping over to the power switch I noticed that the jittery sound reminded me of a song. That song turned out to be The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson. I programmed a small part for the Cello and it sounded great. Who would have ever though to use a Cello for that song? 2 months later.... my video was complete. So Enjoy. I may follow up with a another video showing what circuits, parts and tools that were used to make these robots. 

Muting the guitar strings was a bitch but if you look at the solenoids on Fret 4 and 8 you will see that I covered the pads with foam and velvet. It is soft enough to stop the strings from vibrating.

Some people have been asking about a keyboard sound, Yes there is one but it had such a small part in the song I did not video tape it. However you can see it in action in my other video "The Bit-52's Rock Lobster"
